# Football Player Detection with YOLO

This is a project I made for a computer vision course of the Postgraduate Master's in "Mathematical and Physical Methods for Space Sciences and Industrial Applications" at the University of Turin. The idea was to develop a model for the detection of football players and balls in pictures taken from football matches. To do so, we use the YOLO detection model from Ultrlytics, together with the dataset "Football Player Detection YOLOv8" you can find on Kaggle.
